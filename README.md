AudioTest
=========

AudioTest is a simple Core Audio/Audio Unit iOS app for testing and experimentation. It consists solely of an App Delegate that includes routines to setup, start, stop and teardown a Remote IO Audio Unit based audio system.

It can be useful for testing issues and evaluating ideas.
